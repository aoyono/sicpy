"""
Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better
approximation is given by the value:

(x/yÂ² + 2y)/3

Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure. (In section 1.3.4 we will
see how to implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)
